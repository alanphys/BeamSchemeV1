Not a recognised Windows bitmap file!
-------------------------------------

This error applies to raster image files such as Windows Bitmap (BMP), Tagged Image Format (TIF) and Joint Photographic Expert Group (JPEG) files.  BeamScheme identified this as an :ref:`Image` file but encountered an error opening it. Try opening the file in another image editor to check that the file is valid. If you feel that BeamScheme should be able to open this file please raise an issue on https://github.com/alanphys/BeamSchemeV1/issues with a description of the problem and upload a copy of the file.
