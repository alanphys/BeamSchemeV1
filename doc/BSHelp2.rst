Introduction
============

BeamScheme is an analysis tool for 2D datasets. It will assist you in extracting 1D profiles from 2D datasets and can calculate over 60 different parameters. BeamScheme can open various image and 2D array file formats such as SNC MapCheck, PTW 720, IBA Matrix and StarTrack, Eclipse, XiO, BrainLab, DICOM, jpg, etc.

Parameters include field size, field centre, penumbra, flatness and symmetry. FFF beams are supported with both maximum slope and sigmoid fit parameters available. Profiles can be taken at any angle, offset or thickness. Profiles can be exported to a text file or clipboard for further processing. Results can be exported to PDF.

BeamScheme v1.00 is virtually a complete rewrite of BeamScheme featuring a new parameter calculation engine. The code has been extensively modularised making it easy to add new parameters. New algorithms have been implemented with individual parameter calculation. Extensive unit testing has been implemented. The GUI has been updated. The expression parser has been dropped and all parameters are calculated in the code. Efficiency is achieved by only calculating needed parameters.

BeamScheme is not intended to replace the commercial software available with 2D arrays, but to complement it.



This manual assumes that you are familiar with using your operating system. If you are not then please consult the appropriate documentation and on-line help. BeamScheme can run on a variety of operating systems and while a thorough knowledge of your specific system is not necessary some basic knowledge such as running files will be an advantage.
