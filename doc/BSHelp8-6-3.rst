IFA Factor
==========

Enter the :ref:`In Field Area` (IFA) Factor in the box next to this key. This defines the size of the IFA. If the IFA Type is "Proportional" the IFA Factor is a proportion between 0 and 1 where 0 includes nothing and 1 includes the entire field. This is a numeric value. If the IFA Type is "Circular" the IFA Factor is the absolute radius of the circle. If the IFA Type is square the IFA Factor is the length of the sides of the square.

|Note| The size of the IFA is affected by the resolution for the "Circular" and "Square" IFA types.
