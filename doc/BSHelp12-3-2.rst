No protocol definition files found. Please create a file.
---------------------------------------------------------

BeamScheme on startup looks for protocol definition files in the default program data directory. Under Window this is "C:\Program Data" and under Linux it is  "~/.config/BeamScheme". If no files are found there it will look in the directory where the executable is. If you see this error you probably copied the BeamScheme executable over directly. The recommended method for installation is to use the :ref:`installer<Installation>`. You can also either copy over some protocol definition files or :ref:`create<Editing Protocols>` your own.
