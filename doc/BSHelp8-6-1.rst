Default Resolution
==================

If BeamScheme cannot determine the detector resolution it will default to this value. Values are in dots per inch (dpi). This is useful for film scans where the resolution is not included in the file header such as bmp, jpg and png files. Common resolutions are 75 (Gafchromic) 76 (Xomat), 150 (fax quality) and 300 (normal commercial scanners). This is a numeric field.

|Note| The resolution affects the distances displayed in the profile panes and the calculation of certain results.
