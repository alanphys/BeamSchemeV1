RAW
===

A RAW text file consists of sequential rows of values. Values are separated by spaces. The number of values in a row determines the X dimension. All rows must have the same number of values. The number of rows determines the Y dimension. No resolution or detector spacing is included in the file and the default resolution will be used.
