1D Uniformity ICRU
==================

This is the normalised average between the maximum and minimum profile values taken over the :ref:`in field area<In Field Area>` (IFA) normalised to the average of the IFA:

.. math:: \cfrac {100} {ave} \cdot \cfrac {max + min} {2}
   
Where *max* and *min* are the profile maximum and minimum respectively and *ave* is the average of the profile values in the IFA.

**Protocol invocation name**: 1D Uniformity ICRU

|Note| The *max*, *min* and *ave* may be affected by :ref:`normalisation<Normalisation>` or windowing.
