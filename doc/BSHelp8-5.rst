The Image Pane
==============

The image pane displays the image, 2D array values, dose or fluence map. The image pane can be maximised in the application window by clicking the maximise button |max|. The image pane can be returned to its original state by clicking the minimise button |min|. You can quickly move the profiles to an appropriate point on the image by clicking on this point with the mouse.

The image can be windowed using the slider on the right hand side of the image. Windowing affects the displayed maximum and minimum values and can result in the profile being cut off. Windowing is useful if the image contains dead pixels or burn markers that are distorting the displayed image.

|Note| Windowing affects the profile values.
