Square In Field Area
====================

A square In Field Area can be defined in 'Settings' with a fixed length. Under "Settings" select the IFA type as "Square" and enter the length of the sides of the square as the "IFA Factor". The position of the IFA depends on the "Centre definition" setting. If the Centre definition is "Peak" the IFA is symmetric around the peak of the distribution. If the Centre definition is "Detector" it is symmetric around the geometric centre of the detector.

|Note| The length of the IFA is fixed and independent of the actual field size.
