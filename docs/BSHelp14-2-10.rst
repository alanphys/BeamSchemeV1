FFF-HiRes
=========

This protocol is recommended for high resolution devices such as EPID images.

**Photon Profile Parameters**

FFF parameters only apply to photon beams:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

*  :ref:`Field Edge Left <1D Left Diff>`
*  :ref:`Field Edge Right <1D Right Diff>`
*  :ref:`Field Centre <1D Field Centre Diff>`
*  :ref:`Field Size <1D Field Size Diff>`
*  :ref:`Top position<1D Max Pos>`
*  :ref:`Area Symmetry<1D Symmetry Area>`
*  :ref:`Peak Slope Left<1D Peak Slope Left>`
*  :ref:`Peak Slope Right<1D Peak Slope Right>`
*  :ref:`Peak Slope Ratio<1D Peak Slope Ratio>`


**Flattened field**

FFF beams use the concept of :ref:`In field Area` which is primarily used for the :ref:`Area Symmetry<1D Symmetry Area>` and :ref:`Peak Slope<1D Peak Slope Ratio>` calculations.
