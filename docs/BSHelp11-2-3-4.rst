1D Field Size Diff
==================

The differential field size (*FS*) is defined as the distance from the differential :ref:`left field edge<1D Left Diff>` to the  :ref:`right field edge<1D Right Diff>`:

.. math:: FS = d(RE) - d(LE)

Where *d(RE)* and *d(LE)* are the linear distances from the profile centre to the differential right and left field edges respectively.

**Protocol invocation name**: 1D Field Size Diff

|Note| Noisy data can lead to an inaccurate field size being reported.

|Note| The right and left field edges are affected by the set window levels.
