Uninstalling previous versions
==============================

BeamScheme V1.00 is not compatible with previous versions of BeamScheme so it is necessary to uninstall previous versions before installing the new version. If you wish to retain protocol definition files please back these up manually. Please note that the installation utility will not backup any image or 2D array files in the directory. You will need to do this yourself. To uninstall the program please follow the instructions below:

In Windows open the 'Control Panel' from the main menu, double click 'Programs and Features', (previously known as 'Add Programs') and click on the 'BeamScheme' entry. Select 'Uninstall' or 'Remove'. When BeamScheme has been removed close 'Programs and Features' and close the 'Control Panel'. Any user files such as protocol definition files may need to be removed manually.

Delete the files in the installation directory. If you have any desktop shortcuts or menu links delete those as well. Also delete the directory ~/.config/BeamScheme and any files in it.
