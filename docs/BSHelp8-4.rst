The Results Pane
================

Results may be viewed in the Results pane. For a description of the various parameters calculated please see :ref:`Parameters`.

Parameters are grouped into :ref:`Protocols`. The drop down list box allows you to select a predefined protocol and display the results.

If some parameters are not visible the scroll bar on the right hand side of the pane can be used to scroll down or up to the results.

When the protocol edit mode is selected the Results pane changes to the  :ref:`Edit Protocol <Editing Protocols>` pane.
