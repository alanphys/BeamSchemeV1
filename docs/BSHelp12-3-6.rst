No edge
-------

This message appears in :ref:`The Results Pane` and occurs when the parameter calculation engine cannot detect the edge of the profile. It is usually caused by a cutoff profile, that is the measured linac field size is too large for the detector and the profile does not tend to zero at the ends. Remeasure the profile using a smaller field size, or use a larger detector array.
