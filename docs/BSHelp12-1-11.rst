Unable to load DICOM header segment. Is this really a DICOM compliant file?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The file extension is ".dcm" but BeamScheme cannot find valid DICOM header tags. Try and open the file in another DICOM reader to determine if it is a valid DICOM file. If you feel that BeamScheme should be able to open this file please raise an issue on https://github.com/alanphys/BeamSchemeV1/issues with a description of the problem and upload a copy of the file.
