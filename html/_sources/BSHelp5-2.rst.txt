Installing a new version under Windows
--------------------------------------

Insert your media containing the installation files. Using Windows Explorer navigate to the drive that you inserted. Select the folder containing the files for your site. Double click on the 'setup' program and follow the on screen instructions. It is best to simply accept the default installation values. The protocol definition files from version 0.5X are not compatible with this version and will be copied to a backup directory.
