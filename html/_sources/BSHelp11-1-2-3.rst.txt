2D Uniformity Integral
======================

Returns the maximum difference between the max and the min of the :ref:`In Field Area` normalised to the sum of the min and max according to IAEA pub 1394 section 2.3.3 eq 2.

.. math:: {(max-min)} \cfrac {(max+min)} \cdot {100}

Where *max* and *min* are the IFA maximum and minimum respectively and *ave* is the average value of the IFA.

**Protocol invocation name**: 2D Uniformity Integral

|Note| The *max* and *min* may be affected by the set window levels. No smoothing or pixel summation is done.
