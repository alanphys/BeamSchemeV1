1D Field Centre Diff
====================

The field centre (*FC*) is defined as the distance in cm from the centre of the detector to the centre of the field and is calculated as the half the difference between the distance from the profile centre to the :ref:`right<1D Right Diff>` and :ref:`left<1D Left Diff>` differential field edges or maximum slopes:

.. math:: FC = \cfrac {d(RE) + d(LE)} {2}

Where *d(RE)* and *d(LE)* are the linear distances from the profile centre to the right and left differential field edges respectively.
