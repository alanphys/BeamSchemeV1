1D Differential Parameters
==========================

The first derivative is calculated by numerical differentiation to determine the positive and negative maximum slope values. The differential parameters are calculated relative to the maximum slope. Differentiation is sensitive to noise and the method is not accurate for low resolution detectors such as 2D arrays.

Available differential parameters are:
