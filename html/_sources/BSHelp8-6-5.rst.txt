Centre Definition
=================

This determines how BeamScheme locates the centre of the distribution for the calculation of results. "Peak" locates the centre between the left and right edges of the distribution. "Detector" locates the centre at the geometric centre of the detector. Where there is an even number of detectors or pixels and these straddle the centre the average of the two detectors or pixels is taken. This is a drop down selection field.

|Note| Selection of the centre affects the calculation of parameters
